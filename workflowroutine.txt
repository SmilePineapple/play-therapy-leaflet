TIMEZONE FIX SESSION - Applied comprehensive timezone corrections across all components:

1. Fixed Programme.js - Updated formatTime function to parse datetime strings as local time
2. Fixed SessionDetail.js - Updated formatTime function with same local time parsing logic
3. Fixed MyAgenda.js - Updated formatTime, formatDate, formatDateShort, and groupSessionsByDay functions
4. Fixed MyAgenda.js gap detection - Updated end_time and start_time parsing in gap calculation logic
5. Fixed AdminDashboard.js - Updated formatDate function with local time parsing
6. Fixed QuestionManager.js - Updated formatDate function with local time parsing
7. Fixed Analytics.js - Updated generateTimeRangeData function to handle created_at dates properly

All functions now properly handle datetime strings containing 'T' but no timezone info ('Z' or '+') by manually extracting date/time components and creating local Date objects. This resolves the one-hour time discrepancy issue across the entire application.

The fix ensures consistent time display by avoiding automatic UTC conversion when parsing ISO datetime strings without explicit timezone information.

## Session Complete - Session Sorting Fix

**Date:** 2025-01-01
**Issue:** Session 1.1 (11:15-12:00) appearing in 10th position instead of first
**Root Cause:** Sessions were not being properly sorted because the sorting logic used `start_time` field which doesn't exist in the JSON data - only `formatted_time` and `time` fields exist.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Programme.js` - Fixed session sorting, filtering, and display logic

**Key Changes:**
- Updated loadSessions() sorting to handle multiple time field formats (start_time, formatted_time, time)
- Added secondary sorting by track number when times are identical
- Fixed applyFilters() day filtering to work with available date fields
- Updated uniqueDays calculation to use correct date fields
- Fixed session display JSX to show times from available fields
- Added comprehensive debugging logs to track sorting behavior

**Solution Details:**
- Parse `formatted_time` field ("2025-09-08T11:15:00 - 2025-09-08T12:00:00")
- Parse `time` field ("11.15 - 12.00") and combine with conference date
- Sort by time first, then by track number for sessions at same time
- Ensure session 1.1 appears first as it should be at 11:15-12:00

Sessions are now properly sorted chronologically with track-based sub-sorting.

## Track-Based Sorting Implementation (2025-01-04)

**Issue**: User requested sessions to be ordered by track number instead of time.

**Solution**: 
1. Modified sorting logic in `loadSessions` function to prioritize track number
2. Extract numeric track values using regex to handle track formats like "1.1", "2", etc.
3. Implemented primary sort by track number with secondary sort by time
4. Added debug logging to track the sorting process

**Result**: Sessions are now ordered by track number (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.) with time as secondary sort criteria.

## Playwright Test Suite Improvements (2025-01-04)

**Issue**: Multiple Playwright test failures due to missing components and data-testid attributes.

**Components Created/Fixed**:
1. **About.js** - Created complete About page component with all required sections:
   - Mission, vision, values, history sections
   - Team and board member displays
   - Achievements and statistics
   - Partnership information
   - Contact details
   - Added comprehensive data-testid attributes for testing

2. **About.css** - Created responsive styling for About component

3. **App.js** - Added /about route and imported About component

4. **Admin.js** - Enhanced with proper data-testid attributes:
   - Logout button, navigation tabs (dashboard, questions, moderation, analytics)
   - Main content area
   - Updated h1 text to "Admin Dashboard"

5. **AdminAuth.js** - Improved form validation and testing attributes:
   - Added data-testid attributes for form, inputs, submit button, error messages
   - Enhanced validation with specific error messages ("Email is required", "Password is required")
   - Improved error handling for invalid credentials
   - Added proper form role attribute

6. **AdminDashboard.js** - Added data-testid attributes for statistics:
   - Dashboard stats container
   - Individual stat cards (total questions, pending questions, announcements, sessions, bookmarks)

**Test Results**:
- **Before**: Multiple failures across About and Admin pages
- **After**: 126 tests passing with only 1 flaky test (About page accessibility)
- Significant improvement in test reliability and coverage
- All major components now have proper test infrastructure

**Key Improvements**:
- Resolved timeout issues by adding proper data-testid attributes
- Created missing About page component and route
- Enhanced admin authentication and dashboard testing
- Improved form validation and error handling
- Added comprehensive accessibility attributes
